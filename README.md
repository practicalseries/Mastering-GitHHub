# What is this site about?

This is a complete guide to using GitHub and its annoying, provincial, command line cousin, Git (the one that nobody likes or understands).

GitHub is the online version of Git and both are version control systems for software (websites, applications, programming, documentation, &c. pretty much anything you can develop on a computer). 

They both (but especially Git) have a fairly steep learning curve. GitHub is based upon Git and they both use the same convoluted terminology and have the same underlying software engine.

This site is intended to be a simple, straightforward instruction manual for using Git and GitHub. It is based around Visual Studio Code (also called VS Code), a free and powerful text editor from Microsoft which is used to manage the Git and GitHub interfaces.
